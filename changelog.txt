v1.01
- New ship: Packet Liner

v1.02
- New ship: Thunderer. A high-speed ship good for a lot of things since it's basically a medium warship with the weapon and engine capacities swapped. Weapon selection is limited by being turret-only, but watch out for the pirate gatling variant!
- Added an Auxiliary-style variant (i.e. one with its own graphics and different base stats) of the Cargo Drone that replaces its containers with with fuel tanks. Currently its usefulness is rather limited by the fact that it can't be made to refuel your other ships (at least as far as I know), only undock/redock to restock its own carrier, and you can't decide what ships carry what drones (again as far as I know) so there's no guarantee that your fuel drones will be distributed evenly and be able to refuel all your ships. Handy for the player to have one to refuel while exploring, at least, or do something funny like have afterburner-only propulsion.
- Added an Auxiliary-style variant of the Mudrock with its containers removed and replaced with 12(!) extra drone bays. A semi-easter-egg that can't be purchased, but appears as a rare spawn among human miners so it can be captured.
- Improved Packet Liner bunks (63→73) & drag (7.85→7.8).*
- Improved Mudrock drag (17.8→15.8).*
- Reduced Gemstone fuel further (600→500→400).*
- Reduced Cargo Drone death explosion amount to match vanilla ships of its scale.
- Adjusted Deepvale description (reference to proper-noun "Mining Drones" into generic "drones") and model details (bridge windows, dorsal turret mount size, engine symmetry).
- Added Gemstone variants, along with Mining Drone variants to go with it, mainly used by pirates. The torpedo one's pretty cool since the drones will actually dock to re-arm; not sure this is a feature seen on any vanilla fighters/drones since they generally have energy-based guns installed as well.
- Re-rendered Gemstone with SSAO and made its lower section larger to be a bit more indicative of its stats and how much it slows down when it's full (it should be like a pelican with a full beak); could use more work though.
- Added reverse engine effects to Gemstone and adjusted same effects of Mudrock to match the outward shutter-vents style of the newly-added Thunderer.*
- Fixed Mudrock model shading toward rear end (Deepvale had the same issue before).
- Fleet adjustments; mainly Deepvale & Mudrock less common in the Core region.
- Ships are now sold by their own shipyard, Pickerberry, based on New Britain (Dabih system). They're available in most of the same locations as before – predominantly in the North, South, and near Earth. New shipyards on the industrialized planets of Longjump (Sabik system), Solace (Pherkad system), and New China (Merak system). Their attached outfitters offer a little more dispersed access to ramscoops and large fuel cells (the latter's descriptions imply they should be common on civilian ships, but they're not actually).
* Will only affect newly-acquired ships unless you directly edit your owned ship(s) in your save file.

v1.03
- New ship: Cavalier. A heavy gunboat with a 5/2 gun/turret hardpoint layout and a low-drag armored hull. Middling engine capacity and poor heat dissipation make it a little clunky, but like the Raven it is undeniably capable of punching above its weight.

v1.04
- New ship: Lancier torpedo boat.

v1.05
- Updated mass/drag/heat dissipation values for game version 0.10.8.
