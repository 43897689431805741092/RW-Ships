	description `A heavy high-speed mining ship named for the deep thrum of its massive engine nacelles. Built to keep track of even the fastest-moving asteroids, it is capable of brute-forcing its way up to speeds typical of high-end warships, and its turret mounts and reverse thrust vectoring allow it great freedom of motion during its work.`
	description `	As the engines and cargo bay take up most of the ship's internal volume, it has relatively little space for the systems required to support its power needs, and takes careful outfitting to make the most of its potential.`
	description `	Its suitability for conversion into a warship or blockade runner, making it popular with "independent" captains known to frequent pirate space, has seen its continued production and sale lobbied against a number of times. These efforts have not been consistently sustained, however, due in part to a significant fraction of these ships being manufactured in regions beyond the reach of the law anyway.`
