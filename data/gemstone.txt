	description "A medium asteroid mining platform outfitted to carry a relatively large number of unmanned drones and utility turrets. It is more popular than the Sunder among private captains operating outside of the Core; particularly in the South where there exists mineral wealth that is less safe to exploit in a small ship due to piracy."
