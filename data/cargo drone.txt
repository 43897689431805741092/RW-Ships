	description "Cargo Drones are automated craft, equipped with Hyperdrives, that can accompany their registered parent ship between systems carrying extra cargo. Their popularity has waned over the years due to the rise of piracy, but they remain useful for small-time merchants and local couriers plying the safer regions of space."
	description "	These drones are fairly nimble due to their lightweight (read: cheap & flimsy) construction, allowing them to accompany Shuttles with relative ease."

	add attributes # Removed cargo space is sufficient for 3.75 fuel pods. Assuming 5-6t per 100 integrated fuel storage as opposed to 8t outfits (based on rough calculations of the mass fractions of other ships), an extra 500-600 fuel can be carried quite reasonably.

	description "Fuel Drones are automated craft that can accompany their registered parent ship between systems carrying extra hyperspace fuel. To avoid wasting fuel, these drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive as standard, and are only expected to be undocked from their carrier when the fleet needs to gather more fuel, which a squadron of these drones can do very efficiently with their installed ramscoops and combined surface area."
