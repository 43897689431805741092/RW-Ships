	description "Cargo Drones are automated craft, equipped with Hyperdrives, that can accompany their registered parent ship between systems carrying extra cargo. Their popularity has waned over the years due to the rise of piracy, but they remain useful for small-time merchants and local couriers plying the safer regions of space."
	description "	These drones are fairly nimble due to their lightweight (read: cheap & flimsy) construction, allowing them to accompany Shuttles with relative ease."
