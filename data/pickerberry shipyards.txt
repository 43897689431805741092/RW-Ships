	add description `	New Britain is home to Pickerberry Shipyards, established 2357. Despite close proximity to Tarazed's headquarters, the organization is one of the "old guard" with closer ties to Betelgeuse and Southbound, from whom yard time is frequently leased.` # Full name could be the Pickerberry Ship Breakers & Heavy Plant Co. but that's sort-of just a joke about it being exceptionally British-sounding.
