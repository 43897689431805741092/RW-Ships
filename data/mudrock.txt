	description "One of the earliest heavy freighters to enter mass-production on a modern scale. Once the bedrock of middle-era interstellar expansion, this class was designed primarily for asteroid mining and supporting the construction of spaceborne infrastructure such as the fuel collection and distribution network."
	description "	While lacking in cargo capacity by modern standards, like many of the earliest large starships they were notably over-engineered and gained a reputation for nigh-indestructibility. Some even served as ad-hoc warships during the Alpha Wars."
	description "	The presence of only a single drone bay is an extraneous relic of being designed at a time when a starship was expected to be mobile base, able to do anything and everything, even if that meant nothing in particular could be done well. To save on bulk, the bay area doubles as a cargo lift for (un)loading at port, so the feature is retained even on modern iterations."
