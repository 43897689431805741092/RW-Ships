# Name from French torpilleur, for torpedo boat, or more literally torpedo-ier. Then considering that torpedo launchers are called lance-torpilles, using the portmanteau of lance-ier as a complementary name to the similarly-sized ship named Cavalier that I previously modelled seemed like a fair fit (since just saying Torpedoier or Torpedier sounds kinda weird).

	description "The use of torpedo boats like this originated before the formation of the Republic, when privateering at the behest of powerful corporations was rampant. Being larger (and proportionally more cumbersome) than a modern Navy Rainmaker, it is a rare sight among the more sporadic battles of the present day, but a number of pirate warlords maintain fleets to threaten both their rivals and especially lucrative merchant fleets."
	description "	It is rumored that some of these ships carry nuclear missiles, but this is likely just a distant remnant of its historically fearsome reputation."
